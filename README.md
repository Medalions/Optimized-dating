To run: You will need to run the file in a terminal or some IDE
to see the results. You can technically run it by just clicking it
(if python is installed), but the terminal will disappear as soon
as the program finishes, and you won't see anything else

Disclaimer: I am by no means a programmer in python, I have more
or less just picked up a few things along the way as I am studying
a scientific field. Therefore, if the code is not very optimal or
is outright bad, it is a result of my lack of knowledge and
experience
